Question,Answer
What is C#?,"C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework."
What is the difference between a class and a struct in C#?,"A class is a reference type, while a struct is a value type. Classes are stored on the heap, and structs are stored on the stack."
What are access modifiers in C#?,"Access modifiers in C# are keywords used to specify the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Common access modifiers include public, private, protected, and internal."
What is the difference between ref and out parameters in C#?,"Both `ref` and `out` are used to pass arguments by reference, but `ref` requires the variable to be initialized before it is passed, while `out` does not."
What is encapsulation in C#?,"Encapsulation is an object-oriented concept that binds together the data and the functions that manipulate the data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse."
What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in C#?,"An abstract class can have method implementations, while an interface cannot. A class can inherit from multiple interfaces but only one abstract class."
What is the purpose of the `using` statement in C#?,"The `using` statement is used to ensure that resources like file handles, database connections, or streams are closed or disposed of when they are no longer needed."
What is polymorphism in C#?,"Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, with specific actions determined at runtime. It allows method overriding and overloading."
What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?,"Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different signatures, while method overriding provides a new implementation of a method inherited from a base class."
What is a delegate in C#?,A delegate is a type that represents references to methods. Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.
What is an anonymous method in C#?,An anonymous method is a method without a name that can be assigned to a delegate. It is commonly used with delegates and event handlers.
What is LINQ?,LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that allows querying of collections in a consistent manner. It provides a query syntax similar to SQL.
What is the difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable?,"IEnumerable executes queries in memory (in-memory collection), whereas IQueryable queries are translated into SQL and executed on the database server."
What is async/await in C#?,"Async/await is a feature that allows asynchronous programming by making code non-blocking, improving responsiveness in applications."
What is a lambda expression in C#?,"A lambda expression is a shorthand for writing anonymous methods using the `=>` syntax, and is often used in LINQ queries."
What are generics in C#?,"Generics allow you to define classes, methods, and delegates with placeholders for types, providing type safety without the need for specific data types."
What is the difference between the `finally` and `finalize` in C#?,"`finally` is a block that ensures code execution regardless of exceptions, while `finalize` is a method called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed."
What is a nullable type in C#?,"A nullable type allows a value type, such as int or bool, to hold a null value using the `?` symbol."
What is garbage collection in C#?,Garbage collection is the process by which .NET automatically reclaims memory that is no longer being used by objects.
What is the difference between throw and throw ex in C#?,"`throw` preserves the original stack trace, while `throw ex` resets the stack trace, making it harder to trace the source of an exception."
What is boxing and unboxing in C#?,"Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type (object), and unboxing is the reverse process."
What is a static class in C#?,"A static class cannot be instantiated, and all its members must be static. Static classes are used to contain methods that don't require an object instance."
What is the difference between `const` and `readonly` in C#?,"`const` is a compile-time constant, while `readonly` is a runtime constant whose value can be set only during initialization or in a constructor."
What is dependency injection in C#?,Dependency injection is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling by injecting dependencies into a class instead of allowing the class to create them.
What are extension methods in C#?,Extension methods allow you to add methods to existing types without modifying their original code by using the `this` keyword in method signatures.
What is the difference between `==` and `.Equals()` in C#?,"`==` checks for reference equality, while `.Equals()` checks for value equality (depending on how it's implemented in the class)."
What is the purpose of the `lock` keyword in C#?,"The `lock` keyword ensures that a block of code runs only by one thread at a time, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded environments."
What is reflection in C#?,"Reflection is the ability to inspect and interact with metadata about types at runtime, such as getting information about assemblies, modules, and types."
What are attributes in C#?,"Attributes provide metadata about types, methods, and properties in C#. They are used to add declarative information like `Obsolete`, `Serializable`, etc."
What is the async/await pattern used for?,"The async/await pattern is used to write asynchronous code in a more readable way, allowing the application to remain responsive while performing tasks."
What is an indexer in C#?,An indexer allows objects to be indexed in the same way as arrays. They are defined using the `this` keyword.
What is the difference between String and StringBuilder?,"String is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created. StringBuilder is mutable, allowing modification of strings without creating new instances."
What is a delegate in C#?,A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific signature. It is used for callback methods and event handling.
What are events in C#?,Events are a messaging system in C#. They provide a way for a class to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs.
What is IEnumerable in C#?,IEnumerable is an interface that allows iteration over a collection of a specified type using a `foreach` loop.
What is an abstract class in C#?,An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be inherited by other classes. It can contain abstract methods.
What is a sealed class in C#?,A sealed class cannot be inherited by other classes. It is used to prevent further extension of a class.
What is multi-threading in C#?,"Multi-threading is the ability to execute multiple threads concurrently, improving application performance by doing multiple tasks in parallel."
What is the `dynamic` keyword in C#?,"The `dynamic` keyword allows variables to bypass compile-time type checking and instead be evaluated at runtime, providing flexibility in type handling."
What is the difference between IEnumerable and List in C#?,"IEnumerable is an interface that supports iteration over a collection, while List is a concrete class that provides specific collection operations like adding, removing, and indexing."
What are async streams in C#?,Async streams allow processing sequences of data asynchronously using the `async` and `await foreach` keywords.
What is a lambda expression in C#?,"A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous method using the `=>` syntax, often used with LINQ queries."
What is the difference between throw and throw ex?,"`throw` rethrows an exception while preserving the stack trace, while `throw ex` resets the stack trace, making it harder to trace the origin of the exception."
